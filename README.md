# Draw with Sockets!

Draw with Sockets is a recreation of the web-based drawing game Skribbl.io. This app allowed me to learn Angular, and familiarize myself further with Nodejs and Socket.io.

## Demo

## Hosting your own instance
By using Heroku, you can deploy a temporary container that runs Draw with Sockets. The container will not have any cost and automatically suspend as soon as it stops receiving traffic for a while.

Simply create an account at https://id.heroku.com/login and then click this link:
